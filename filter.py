    General outline of video analysis script is as follows:
    1. Bilateral filter: to smooth image while keeping sharp shark edges. This step is very slow but
       greatly increases detection accuracy.
    2. Convert from RGB to HSV: to get to a color space that'll be easier to set filter limits in.
    3. Masking: this is the step that changes most from video to video. Play around with filtering here to get
       satisfactory edge detection. This script has two filters, often one will suffice.
    4. Convert from HSV to Grayscale: the findContours function requires grayscale images
    5. Set threshold and find Contours
